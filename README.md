## üìÅ Projects Included

### 1. üéØ Number Guessing Game
- **Concepts:** Loops, conditionals, random numbers, input/output
- **How it works:** The computer generates a random number, and the user keeps guessing until they get it right.
- **Library:** `random`

### 2. üßÆ Calculator App
- **Concepts:** Functions, input/output, loops
- **How it works:** Takes two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and returns the result.

### 3. üìù To-Do List (Console-Based)
- **Concepts:** Lists, file handling (optional), loops
- **How it works:** User can add, remove, view, and optionally save tasks to a file.

### 4. üé≤ Dice Rolling Simulator
- **Concepts:** Random module, loops
- **How it works:** Simulates the roll of a dice every time the user requests.

### 5. üîê Password Generator
- **Concepts:** Strings, loops, random
- **How it works:** User selects password length and character types; the program generates a secure password.
